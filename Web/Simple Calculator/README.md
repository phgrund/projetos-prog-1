# Simple Calculator made in JavaScript
This is my first time programming with JS.    
The calculator works pretty simple.    
• 1st option = 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + N², where N is the limit.    
• 2nd option = it calculates the factorial of the given number. Ex: N = 5 => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5.    
• 3rd option = it calculates the following combination: C(A,B) = F(A)/ F(A-B), where 'A' and 'B' being the given numbers, 'C' being combination and 'F' being factorial.
